Exploding blocksworld generator.
Author: Blai Bonet upon a code by John Asmuth and domain by Michael Littman and David Weissman
Needs Thiebaux and Slaney's bwstates generator (included)
Modified slightly so that it uses different naming convention to the original &
doesn't have some advanced PDDL features (e.g different metrics for goal
reward).

make
usage: ./ex-blocksworld <name-suffix> <blocks-in-goal> `./bwstates -s 2 -n <#-blocks> -r <seed>`
