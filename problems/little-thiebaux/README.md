# Iain & Little planning problems

These problems have previously appeared in Iain Little & Sylvie Thiebaux's
planning papers. They were downloaded from
[here](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~thiebaux/benchmarks/pddl/). The climber,
river, bus fare, and triangle tire domains are designed to be "probabilistically
interesting"; the significance of this property is explained in Little &
Thiebaux's [Probabilistic Planning vs.
Replanning](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~iain/icaps07.pdf).
